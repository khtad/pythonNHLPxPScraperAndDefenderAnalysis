# Strength Estimation Approaches (Superseded)

This document has been superseded by the more detailed xG-focused implementation roadmap:

- Main roadmap: `docs/xg_model_roadmap.md`
- Component docs: `docs/xg_model_components/`

The new roadmap reflects updated requirements for a full-feature xG system, RAPM-based player estimation, and team strength aggregation from player impacts.
