# Component 06: RAPM Adjustments on xG

## Scope
Estimate player offensive and defensive impacts using xG-based response variables and RAPM-style regularization.

## Deliverables
- Player design matrices for on-ice/off-ice context.
- Regularized model framework (ridge/elastic-net or hierarchical Bayes).
- Separate offensive and defensive impact outputs.
- Uncertainty intervals and stability diagnostics.

## Validation
- Year-over-year stability checks.
- Position-group sanity comparisons (F/D/G handling).
- Sensitivity to regularization strength.

## Extension points
- Dynamic (time-varying) player coefficients.
- Usage-aware priors and aging-curve integration.
